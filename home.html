<h3><p>Welcome to OpenAlt! On this website, you can help add alt-text to images on the web that don't already have them. In addition, you can edit alt-texts that others have made to ensure that they follow the guidlines for descriptive alt-texts below. These alt-texts will be used by screen readers to describe images to people who are blind. When writing alt-texts, they should follow the guidlines below.</p>
<br>
<p> Guidelines for Adding Alt Text
<br>
General:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be succinct while still maintaining key elements of the image being described</li>
<li>Remove filler or unimportant words when possible</li>
<li>Describe the information, not the picture</li>
<li>Often times, it is more important to describe the significance of the image rather than the shape, i.e. Twitter's logo should be described as "Twitter" in alt text and not "blue bird"</li>
</ul>
Specific:<br>
<dl>
<dt>For decorative images:</dt>
<dd>- Leave the alt text blank</dd>
<dt>For informative images<sup>1</sup>:</dt>
<dt>Complex images (such as charts or graphs):</dt>
<dd>- Include a general statement describing what the image outlines</dd>
<dd>- Include a summary of the general trend of the data</dd>
<dd>- Include a link to a long description containing specific numerical values shown in tables and charts</dd>
<dt>Textual Images (such as landscapes):</dt>
<dd>- Include relevant and important details</dd>
<dd>- Be descriptive while remaining concise</dd>
<dt>For active images (such as buttons or links):</dt>
<dd>- Include what the image does when clicked (i.e. where a link would send the user)</dd>
<dt><sup>1</sup>To determine whether an image is decorative or informative:</dt>
<dd>If removing the image detracts from the user's understanding, it is informative. If not, it is decorative.</dd>
